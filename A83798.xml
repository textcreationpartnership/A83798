            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The 1 Article was to this effect, that M. <hi>Pym</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the other ≈øcilicet) hath traiterou≈øly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ≈øubvert the fundamentall lawes, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England:</hi> this ≈øeemes contrary, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that hee ≈øolely did alwayes oppo≈øe any man, whom hee either found or could ≈øu≈øpect guilty of the ≈øame crime, and hath laboured rather to ratifie, and confirme the fundamentall lawes, the either ≈øubvert or confound the ≈øame. For in his Diurnall Speeches in the <hi>Parliament</hi> was alwayes ≈øpecified his reall intent, in the in≈øtitution, and not diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ≈øubver≈øion of any law: which was not detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to the ≈øafety, and pro≈øperity of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, In the ≈øame Article it is mentioned, that with all he hath indeavoured to deprive the King of His Royall power, and to place in ≈øubjects in arbitrary power over the Lives, Liberties, and E≈øtates of His Maje≈øties liege people. To this your Petitioners an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øwer, that we have found him ≈øo diligent to advance your Maje≈øties royall Dignity and Crowne, that he hath ≈øeemed rather to ad, then in any wi≈øe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your Maje≈øty of any power, appertaining to your royall Selfe: and for the ≈øub≈øequent conclu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find, that otherwi≈øe; for hee hath given his vote in the <hi>Hou≈øe of Commons</hi> again≈øt the ≈øame. We proceed now to the 2.

               <p>To this your Petitioners pre≈øume to an≈øwer thus: as in the former Article we have ≈øpecified the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of his mind, free from entertaining the lea≈øt thought of ca≈øting a≈øper≈øions either on your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties per≈øon or government: ≈øo likewi≈øe we do ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his innocuous intent herein, that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heare, know, or perceive him at any time min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to alienate the affections of any of his people, &amp; if any per≈øon, or per≈øons will maintaine, or prove the ≈øame again≈øt him, or them, that he did indeavour to divert their affections from your Maje≈øty, hewill acknowledge him≈øelfe guilty thereof, and ju≈øtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cv≈øed for the ≈øame. But that he ≈øhould indeavour to make your Maje≈øty odious vnto any, it ≈øeems incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; for your Petitioners know, that the hearts &amp; affectionss of your ≈øubjects, are ≈øo unitely fixed on you both in their prayers, hopes, and wi≈øhes, that we impartially beleeve, that no man would become ≈øo di≈øloyall, as to ≈øub≈øtract any re≈øpective obedience from your Maje≈øty, much le≈ø≈øe that your owne roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all per≈øon ≈øhould become odious unto them.</p>
               <p>We now arrive at the 3. Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> That hee hath endeavoured to draw your Maje≈øties late Army into di≈øobedience to your Maje≈øties Commands, and to ≈øide with them in their trayterous de≈øignes.</p>
